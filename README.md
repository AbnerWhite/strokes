Strokes v1.0
============

Strokes is a project meant to help you learn Chinese characters.

Currently it allows you to create a printable worksheet that will teach you
stroke order and Pinyin pronunciation of any of over 9000 supported characters.
Here's an example of what happens when you enter 一二三四:

![Strokes - example output](docs/example_defaults_yi_to_si.png?raw=true)

As you can see, each stroke is drawn four times: 1) alone, 2) with all strokes
introduced so far, 3) in context and 4) in context but with no aid, so that
you can practice the proportions on your own. At the end of each pair you are
supposed to rehearse by filling in complete characters, which should help you
memorize the strokes.

All HSK 1-6 characters all supported.
