Strokes v1.0
============

Strokes is a project meant to help you learn Chinese characters.

Currently it allows you to create a printable worksheet that will teach you
stroke order and Pinyin pronounciation of any of over 9000 supported
characters. Here's an example of what happens when you enter 一二三四:

![Strokes - example output](docs/example_defaults_yi_to_si.png?raw=true)

You are expected to print out the PDF generated by the project and fill in the
blank space within the strokes marked in bold.

As you can see, each stroke is drawn four times: 1) alone, 2) with all strokes
introduced so far, 3) in context and 4) in context but with no aid, so that
you can practice the proportions on your own. At the end of each pair you are
supposed to rehearse by drawing complete characters, which should help you
memorize strokes for all characters introduced so far. The way it is set up
by default, you should actually not only train your short-term memory, but also
long-term, making you remember characters longer!

All HSK 1-6 characters all supported.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

Unfortunately, the project is not trivial to run for non-programmers. You will
need to learn how to run Docker applications in order to start it.

Assuming that your system already has both docker and docker-compose installed,
starting should be as easy as running `docker-compose up` as `root` (e.g. by
adding `sudo ` at the beginning of the command). After a few moments, you
should see the following text in your terminal:

`server_1    |  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

Assuming that this happened, Strokes should be available using your browser.
Just visit the following URL: http://localhost:5000/

Generating the PDF
------------------

After visiting the project's URL, you should see a form with a few text
boxes, as well as buttons. To just use default settings, remove the current
contents of "Characters" box and enter any characters you want to learn.
Keep in mind that all whitespace characters (including just "space") will be
removed and all non-Chinese characters will cause an error.

Once you're done,
click "Generate PDF" and wait a while. It takes the program about two seconds
per page in order to prepare a printable file. If you don't want to be waiting
just to get the same file, press Ctrl+S and save it somewhere.

I suggest you just print first few pages if you're trying Strokes out - you
might want to fiddle with the following options:

* **Size** - decrease this if you want resulting document to be zoomed out or
increase if you want more room for your strokes. This really depends on your
drawing tool - I just an extra-fine Pilot Plumix fountain pen and size of 15
is optimal for me while practicing for HSK2,

* **Number of repetitions** - you might have different goals and preferred
styles when using Strokes. The default "1" means that you'll only do each phase
of learning once per stroke. If you increase it to 2, each phase will be
repeated, resulting in more practice. You might find it useful when practicing
one of the more difficult characters. If you set it to 0, you'll only see
"next stroke with context" phase used - this is what I'd use if I was to
quickly get familiar with lots of characters but didn't really care about
getting enough practice.

* **Sorting** - this lets you rearrange characters you entered in "Characters"
box. Right now there are two options - "None" which won't change the ordering
and "Pinyin" which will reorder them, sorting them by pronounciation. You can
also remove duplicates, which will mean that each character will only appear
once in the set (don't worry, it will still be repeated - just not more than
other characters).

* **Preview** - if you only want to get a preview of what the program will
generate, use this button. It will be faster and you will quickly get an idea
of whether you want to change anything. Keep in mind that this is not meant
for printing and sizing might be wrong (but number of pages won't).

If you're preparing for HSK, you can just copy a .txt list as program's
input and jump straight to learning. Example file you can just copy into the
"Characters" field is this one:

http://data.hskhsk.com/lists/HSK%20Official%202012%20L1.txt

(Change the L1 at the end of the document to L2 or L-some-other-number if
you're practicing for HSK2 or higher.)

Tricks and tips
---------------

Give the program a chance even if you find the number of pages it generated
overwhelming. They are conveniently split into regions, letting you stop
your practice session quite often.

Experiment. Not only with options, but also with your writing tools. Find some
way to make learning pleasant. If this means you need a more expensive pen, do
it. The program's for free, you're not paying for any teacher, you might as
well consider it an investment.

When choosing the value of "Size" option, keep in mind that things might get
cluttered once you start entering complex characters. That's why I introduced
first ("just this stroke") phase of writing a stroke - so that you will notice
that you're drawing a new one already. It's easy to drift off while practicing
and this phase is meant to help you go out of the rhythm so you can concentrate
again.

Consider using ink color other than black. So far I tried Pelikan's "brilliant
red" and it wasn't up to my expectations and right now I'm using their green.
Using anything other than black will mean you will see when you draw outside
of the borders.

How does it work?
=================

Glad you asked! Most of the credit really should go Skishore for putting
together graphics.txt file, which contains SVG data for each stroke of
supported characters, with order retained. He then used it in
[his Inkstone Android
program](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.id126c0rsxlvjwv18cf44u&hl=en)
(definitely worth its Google Play price!) which I found really cool, but not
perfect when learning chinese characters for the first time - at least not for
me. Instead of hacking Skishore, I decided to write a Flask application that
reads graphics.txt and generates tiles with specific strokes hidden and others
highlighted.

The only problem was how to render SVG into a format that guarantees that
proportions are kept. I didn't either trust or want to learn how to interact
with reliable HTML printing, so I worked on SVG to PDF rendering solution.

I think I first experimented with Inkscape, but the output PDFs were too large.
I then went with Google Chrome in headless mode, which is what drives the
connected Docker container, d33tah/html2pdf. You can find its code here:

https://github.com/d33tah/html2pdf

Because of its size, I decided to put it in a separate container so this one
only contains programs related to running Flask apps.

Please file a Github issue if you want any more specific information here.

Bugs, problems
==============

I can't figure out why it's impossible to zoom in the SVG files generated by
my program, at least not in Firefox. Help would be welcome!
